If you are a big fan of Pokemon, consider building a Pokemon app using PokeAPI. With this API, you can extract all the characteristics of Pokemon.This would definitely be a fun project and one of the best React projects for beginners. As you will use the PokeAPI to get the details of Pokemon, you can create different cards for each Pokemon and highlight their images, names, and other details. You can add the ' Read More ' button to include more details about Pokemon on each card.</p>
